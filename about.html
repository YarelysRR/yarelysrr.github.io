                    Â¡Hola! I transitioned into tech after years of working in non profit organizations. I have mixed
                    experiences due to my educational background. Before the transition, my experience was 4yrs of
                    leadership in a non profit in Seattle,WA.

                    This leap did not come out of the blue, I always try to stay up to date with
                    technology and I'm also a great admire of many tools/ extensions, etc that are created
                    for people like me to learn and take advantage of it.
                    </br>
                    For example, during 2020 I started a project to provide a training platform for my program. I
                    curated list of trainings I found online, plus created and edited training videos for staff that
                    I facilitated with my then manager. Using a google extension (certify'em) I was able to
                    implement automatization so when I stafff finished watchiing video they could click on a link,
                    complete a post test and then receive certificate if they met conditions establishes to pass.
                    </br> This idea improve training process at our program and eventually other program in the
                    organization used it as in general the org did not have a training platform.
                    </br>
                    On my free time, I was little by little learning web development by taking courses in
                    freecodecamp, sheCodes, CodeCademy, etc. I noticed how engage I was, all of the sudden I felt
                    many things clicked for me. This is when I made the decision to quit my jon and join a bootcamp.
                    </br>
                    I am very curious, my mother has many fantastic stories to tell. I love learning new things,
                    solving challenges, improve processess. My goal is to become a Technical Program Manager.


                    <!-- However, 
                        transitioning into tech did not come out of the blue.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since I got my first computer I was infatuated with it plus I've been a gamer since Duck Hunt
                        and NBA JAM.</a>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I was that person that would stay up to date with tech and would
                        like to reasearch about how tech is improving our life. For example, during my MA I did a paper
                        about users's gender swaping in games, plus did a project blog to talk about how tech was
                        allowing citizens to become "street journalist", they now were <a
                            href="https://imperiociudanismo.wordpress.com/%c2%bfperiodismo-ciudadano/" target="_blank">
                            reporting incidents</a> from their point of view. We know how that has evolved

                Â¡Hola! transitioned into tech after years of working in non profit organizations. My
                last experience was 4yrs of leadership(Program Manager then Director of a department). The
                transition did not come
                out of the blue, since I was a teenager I was infatuated with computers but never though this
                career was for me since
                "I was not good at math" nor at the moment did not see any role model to follow. However, I've
                been always that I was
                that
                wanabbe IT person in the job
                that coworkers go to solve many tech issues, I like to stay up to date with tech to make
                my
                life
                easier. When I moved to
                Seattle and heard about all the opportunities for non tech degrees, I got excited. First
                step, I
                decided to take a web
                development course that I completed after work to see of I would like it... and I LOVED
                IT.
                After some months I quit my
                job and started cohort in Generation. I love learning new things, therefore, tech
                industry
                is
                such a fascinating field.
                My long term goal is to become a Technical Program Manager.
